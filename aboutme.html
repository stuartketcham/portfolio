               <div class="aboutme">
                  <p>Thanks for coming to my website and taking the interest to read a bit about me.</p>
                  <p>I moved to Seattle, WA from upstate New York about 25 years ago.  My life in Seattle has been spent primarily as a developer.  My most recent development work was as a Microsoft SQL Server developer for a major telecom company, which I did for 13 years.</p>
                  <p>In December 2020, I completed my associate’s degree in science for Liberal Arts/Sciences. I am currently working on my bachelor's degree at Bellevue college. My major is Data Management and Analysis with a concentration in Business Intelligence.</p>
                  <p>I have enjoyed working with and learning about computers since I was a child and still enjoy taking classes to keep up to date on the latest technology.  From most recent to longest ago, the development classes I have taken were in Python, PL/SQL, T-SQL, Java, XML, HTML, C++., C, Visual Basic, Pascal, and BASIC.  I treat learning as an ongoing process and take classes every chance I get.  My favorite classes in school were always the sciences, especially programming languages, astronomy, and physics.</p>
                  <p>I am married and have two young children.  My family is essential to who I am.  For exercise, and as a hobby, I enjoy cycling, which is how I stay healthy.</p>
                  <p>If you think I’d be a good fit for your team, please contact me for more information.</p>
