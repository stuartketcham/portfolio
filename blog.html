              <h2 class="blog_heading">Blog Entry - 4/29/2022 - Is flying safer than driving?</h2>
              <div class="blog_entry">
                <p>Everyone has heard "Flying is safer than driving," usually from a news source. Have you ever wondered if it was true? Instinctively, flying seems more risky than driving, but that isn't a logical way to compare.
                I was curious to see if it was true. So, I looked into the articles that make this safety claim. The studies I found compared one of two things: Overall risk in your life or risk per mile. That was all. Risk per mile isn't how people estimate travel risk, and overall lifetime risk isn't a valid comparison at all. Some people never fly in their whole lives, and pilots fly all the time. Do they have the same lifetime risk? No. So, aggregating a population's lifetime risk is useless from a practical standpoint.<br>
                The per-mile risk makes sense if you are planning a trip and want to compare driving across the US to flying across the US. However, that is only one aspect of comparing risk and is a very specific use case. "Flying is safer than driving" makes it sound like any time you get into a car, you are taking a bigger risk than any time you get into a plane.<br>
                To check the safety risk at a "per trip" level, we should compare the number of fatalities to the number of trips.<br>
                <div class="blog_subheading">Flying risk</div>
                <p>According to a Reuters article (source 1 below), there were .27 fatal accidents per million flights. Let's make that whole numbers, so 27 fatal crashes / 100,000,000 flights. That's very low, which tells you it's pretty safe, but is it safer than driving to work?<br>
                The article also says that in 2020 there were 5 fatal crashes of commercial airplanes totaling 299 deaths, so 60 deaths each. We should multiply crashes by the number of deaths to get the per person risk.<br>
                27 flights * 60 deaths = 1,620 deaths / 100,000,000 flights. <br>
                <div class="blog_subheading">Driving risk</div>
                <p>According to the NHTSA (source 2 below), there were 38,824 deaths in the US in 2020.<br>
                According to Energy.gov (source 3 below), there were 366,000,000,000 trips in the US in 2020.<br>
                So, that&rsquo;s 38,824 deaths / 366,000,000,000 trips. Per person risk is already built-in here because our number is already the number of deaths, not the number of crashes.<br>
                <div class="blog_subheading">Comparison</div>
                <p>Let's compare 1 billion trips for each mode of travel.<br>
                Flight: 16,200 deaths / 1 billion trips<br>
                Ground travel: 106 deaths / 1 billion trips<br>
                That makes getting on a plane about 150x riskier than getting in a car for any random trip of any length.<br>
                <div class="blog_subheading">Caveats</div>
                <p>Yes, I did compare the rates of cars in the US to the rates of flights on the globe, but I am comparing rates, not totals. So, that is only unfair if the car fatality rate in the US is far, far higher than the rate for the whole planet. I don't have what I would consider reliable numbers for this, so this is a little shaky, but from what I have seen, Europe is lower on-road fatality rates, but India and China are higher, so the US might be a little low, on average.<br>
                <p>Comparing any specific trip would have too many factors to calculate, for example, weather, vehicle condition, vehicle operator experience and fitness, and, of course, length of the trip. Since we have seen that per mile risk is lower for flight, it is probably the biggest factor since the others would be unlikely to overcome a 1 to 150 ratio.<br>
                <p>I am defining "safety" as the risk of dying. If you compare risk using deaths and injuries combined, that changes the picture completely. Finding consistent numbers for driving-related injuries is difficult because different sources define "injury" differently. It appears to be somewhere between 20 and 100 times higher than fatalities. Source 4, below, is older (2009), but it shows that aviation-related hospitalizations from commercial flying are lower than deaths. This makes sense as plane crashes are far more likely to be fatal than car crashes. This closes the gap to nearly equal risk, given the most extreme number sample.
                <div class="blog_subheading">Conclusion</div>
                <p>Method comparison:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Per mile: Flight is safer</li>
                  <li>Lifetime risk: Flight is safer (especially if you never get on a plane in your life)</li>
                  <li>Per trip: Driving is safer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Does this mean any particular person should fear getting onto a plane? The risk is still very low. So, they shouldn't fear getting on a plane. However, it looks like the blanket statement "flying is safer than driving" doesn't hold up from every angle.<br>
                It certainly looks like a commercial pilot is at a much higher risk than a cabbie, but that is unlikely to surprise anyone.<br>
