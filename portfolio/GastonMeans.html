            <h2>
               Crime Details
            </h2>
            <p>
               Gaston Bullock Means had a long history of confidence schemes and even
               served time in jail by the time he stole over $100,000 with his final
               confidence trick.
            </p>
            <p>
               In this case, the victim was not the Lindbergh family themselves, but
               rather an interested and wealthy third party, Evalyn Walsh McLean. She was
               a famous heiress and wife of Edward McLean, the owner and publisher of The
               Washington Post for 17 years. Evalyn McLean was the Hope Diamond owner for
               a period and is immortalized for her diplomacy work in the lyrics of the
               song “Anything Goes” (Cole Porter 1934). McLean appears to have involved
               herself in the Lindberg case from altruistic motives, or perhaps for
               additional notoriety.
            </p>
            <p>
               Gaston Means was always looking for opportunities to swindle people out of
               money. He had already been trying to swindle money from “several rich men”
               (Hoover, 1936, pg. 84) regarding the Lindbergh kidnapping when Evalyn
               McLean sought him out. She believed him to have contacts in the underworld
               due to his reputation and a previous conviction and wanted his help in
               tracking down the kidnappers.
            </p>
            <p>
               Based on his claims to be in contact with the kidnappers, McLean turned
               over $100,000 to Means to pay the ransom. Means proceeded to weave a long
               series of stories to keep McLean from knowing she had been tricked and
               possibly get additional money from her. Promises to deliver the baby
               ensued, along with a confederate posing as a kidnapper, and other
               deceptions all designed to confuse Mrs. McLean. Eventually, she did go to
               the police, which lead to Means’s trial and conviction.
            </p>
            <h2>
               Theories
            </h2>
            <p>
               Gaston Means deceived countless people and even government agencies before
               his final conviction. For the most part, he was quite successful as a “con
               man.”
            </p>
            <p>
               Behavior theory states that behaviors that yield rewards are likely to be
               repeated. This theory applies to Gaston Means’s confidence trick of Mrs.
               McLean as he had previously gotten away with many crimes, reaping the gains
               without paying the consequences. By that time, his dishonesty had garnered
               him enough money to support his family in a “mansion with three servants
               and a chauffeur-driven limousine.” (Yanchisin, 1991, paragraph 9)
            </p>
            <p>
               Rational choice theory proposes that Gaston likely made a decision to
               commit the crime that was at least logical to him. Given all his previous
               successful crimes, he probably perceived the risk as relatively low
               compared to the potentially substantial financial gain.
            </p>
            <h2>
               Theory 1 – Behavior Theory
            </h2>
            <p>
               “Behavior theory posits that individual behavior that is rewarded will
               increase in frequency and behavior that is punished will decrease in
               frequency.” (Schmalleger pg. 92.) A pattern of positive reinforcement of
               criminal activity through financial gain, and the absence of judicial
               punishment, is a theme throughout Gaston Means’s life.
            </p>
            <p>
               Why would Gaston Means choose to try to trick someone into giving him over
               $100,000 (nearly $2 million in 2020)? As often happens with criminals, the
               crimes start small, and a pattern develops over time. In his youth, he
               stole money from his mother’s purse and derived satisfaction from seeing
               their maid fired for the crime. (Yanchisin, 1991, paragraph 2)
            </p>
            <p>
               After a few years of attempting life working within the public school
               system, and as a salesman, he began work as a detective for the New York
               City detective agency of William J. Burns, formerly chief of the U.S.
               Secret Service. Here his life of dubious activities seems to start. Some of
               the activities he engaged in, both assigned and not assigned, range from
               the questionable to the criminal.
            </p>
            <p>
               Other than the Lindbergh hoax, his most audacious crime was the defrauding
               and murder of Maude King, a wealthy widow. He worked his way into her
               confidence and gained control of her assets. After losing all her money in
               the stock market, Means took her on a hunting trip and returned with her
               dead body, reporting that she had shot herself. This, finally, did gain the
               attention of the authorities, and he was put on trial. Despite a convincing
               case against him, Gaston Means was found not guilty of murder and went
               free. Literally getting away with murder must have had an impact on his
               future behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
               “Human behavior, according to the behavioral perspective, is thus a
               response to the environment… The presence or absence of a behavior in the
               future depends on the balance between rewards and punishments associated
               with it now…. The association between criminal activities and the rewards
               of excitement, thrill, money, praise, and group membership will increase
               the individual’s participation in these activities, despite the risks of
               punishment and social disapproval.” (Hoss, Moloney, &amp; Chambliss, 2016,
               pg. 369)
            </p>
            <p>
               The pattern of ongoing reward without punishment must have given Means a
               sense of invulnerability, lending his ongoing schemes a scale seldom seen
               in history, up until the Lindbergh baby hoax, where he finally received his
               comeuppance.
            </p>
            <h2>
               Theory 2 – Rational Choice Theory
            </h2>
            <p>
               Rational choice theory is “a perspective holding that criminality is the
               result of conscious choice and predicts that individuals choose to commit
               crime when the benefits outweigh the costs of disobeying the law.”
               (Schmalleger pg. 41.) Based on his experience and knowledge of his victim,
               Gaston Means evaluated that his rewards outweighed the risks of committing
               the crime.
            </p>
            <p>
               Confidence tricks fall somewhat between the cracks when categorizing crime.
               It is a sort of act that is partly robbery and partly white-collar crime.
               We should classify this specific crime as the latter due to the gentile
               manner in which it was handled.
            </p>
            <p>
               When looking at white-collar crimes, rational-choice theory comes much more
               into play than it does for violent or impulsive crimes. Over time, Gaston
               Means must have regularly questioned the risk involved in the commission of
               his crimes but experiencing his repeated success must have given him the
               confidence to continue.
            </p>
            <p>
               In the commission of the crime against Mrs. McLean, he concluded that the
               size of the reward outweighed the risk of prison. After all, she had
               approached him, not the other way around. Further, she had a national
               reputation to protect and would not want to appear to be a fool.
               Furthermore, he probably judged from experience that he was unlikely to be
               convicted or may never even face prosecution. “All too often prosecutors
               fail to charge individuals for white-collar crime” (Jaakson, Johannsen,
               Karin, Vadi, Ashyrov, Mari-Liis 2019, pg. 98)
            </p>
            <p>
               Gary Becker, a proponent of the rational choice model, proposed a formula
               in 1968 that represents an evaluation of a potential criminal’s risk vs.
               reward from a crime.
            </p>
            <p>
               EU = pU (Y– f) + (1 – p) U (Y)
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                “p” represents the risk of being caught
              </li>
              <li>
                “U” is a complex variable including things like potential income from
              legal activities and education
              </li>
              <li>
                “Y” is the income from the offense
              </li>
              <li>
                “f” is the monetary equivalent of punishment
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               (above from Becker 1968)
            </p>
            <p>
               The actual value of p is unknown to the criminal, so it actually represents
               the criminal’s perceived risk. Based on a lifetime of experience, Gaston
               Means’s confidence would lower the p factor to near zero for the McLean
               confidence trick. Factor out p and all that remains is the potential
               income, weighted against his education and potential legitimate earnings.
               Given his history, he must have seen the risk as very low compared to the
               reward.
            </p>
            <p>
               After being given the $100,000 so easily, he probably believed that she was
               foolish enough to let him keep it if he spun a convincing enough web of
               lies. He spent the succeeding days and weeks believing that he could
               convince McLean that the money had gone to the kidnappers and that he was
               blameless.
            </p>
            <p>
               Even before the Lindbergh baby’s body was found, everything fell apart for
               Means when Mrs. McLean went to the authorities, suspecting that she had
               been conned. He went to jail for larceny but never admitted his guilt, and
               to this day, the money has never been found.
            </p>
            <h2>
               Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p>
               Even after he died in prison, Gaston Bullock Means has somehow managed to
               craft his own legacy, even if it is as a criminal. His recorded exploits
               are larger than life, bordering on the cartoonish. Researching him, it
               becomes difficult to determine how much is real and how much hyperbole.
            </p>
            <p>
               Whatever his motives, and whatever his crimes, he remains a fascinating
               character and is one of the few criminals from American history to make a
               lasting impression based on the brilliance of his storytelling and
               trickery, rather than purely on brutal atrocities.
            </p>
            <p>
               He was given, by his family, opportunities that should have leant him away
               from the need to seek a life of crime. Instead, small early delinquencies
               trained him that crime had plentiful rewards, leading to larger and more
               frequent crimes. He made what he considered a rational choice to pick this
               avenue as something that appealed to him and would provide him with a
               comfortable life. Both factors culminate in the Lindbergh baby confidence
               trick, which finally ended his career.
