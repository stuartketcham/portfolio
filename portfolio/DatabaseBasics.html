	<div class="Heading1">
	<h1><a id="_Toc45717242"></a>1.Introduction</h1>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">You have questions about databases, and I am here to answer
	them. I have nearly 20 years of professional experience working with Microsoft
	(MS) SQL Server, Oracle, Teradata, and MS Access. I intend to share with you
	what a database is, how to decide when you need a database and cover the basics
	of how to use one.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">The database I selected for use in this document is MS SQL
	Server. I like its balance of ease-of-use and powerful features. It is very
	widely used and is the database product I worked with the most; over 13 years
	of developing applications with its technology.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">You will find that a database is the most powerful option
	for storing, serving, and organizing data. The flexibility, reliability, and
	performance offered in an MS SQL Server database cannot be matched by other
	methods of storing data, like MS Excel, or lower-tier database offerings like
	MS Access.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">Any set of data from sales records, statistics, or employee
	performance reports to airplane routes, music scores, or recipes can benefit
	from the features a database can provide. People around the world leverage the
	structure, reliability, and power of databases. So can you.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">In addition, if you plan on pursuing a career in databases,
	or even just want to try things out to further your education, I think you will
	find the information here to be of great interest.</p>

	<div class="Heading1">
	<h1><a id="_Toc45717243"></a>2.What is a database?</h1>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">At its most basic, a database is a system that imposes
	structure on data. While that may not mean software 100% of the time, you
	won’t see a paper "database" very often anymore.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">There is a wide variety of database software available
	today. Modern databases can be geared to be easy to use (MS Access) or have
	free licenses (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) or are the more traditional
	enterprise-level platforms that have huge flexibility, scalability, and support
	(Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, IBM DB2).</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">What they all have in common is that they take that idea of
	organizing data, and they build on it extensively. Even the free database
	options offer a huge number of features and a wide variety of programmability.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717244"></a>2.1 Comparing MS SQL Server to MS Excel</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Why am I comparing MS SQL Server to MS Excel? Many people
	are familiar with using Excel to store organized data, while few have worked
	directly with databases. It offers a point of comparison that people can use
	as a basis for understanding databases.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Why am I not talking about MS Access? If you are here to
	learn database basics for a career, there are far more jobs using MS SQL Server
	than MS Access. Alternately, if you are here looking for business solutions, I
	would encourage you to skip MS Access. It doesn't offer as many features, and
	if you are outgrowing Excel, Access is not likely to be a long-term solution.</p>

	<h3>2.1.1 Similarities</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Conceptually, you could look at SQL Server tables as each a
	single spreadsheet. However, SQL Server tables and Excel spreadsheets both
	offer many features that the other doesn’t have.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">A spreadsheet and a database table both store data in rows
	and columns. Both products offer tools that allow you to sort your data, filter
	your data, or search for specific pieces of data within your larger set of data.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">They both offer a wide array of functions to manipulate your
	data, though the functions offered in each differ substantially. &nbsp;I feel
	specifics about those functions go beyond the scope of an introduction, so we
	won’t be covering those here.</p>

	<h3>2.1.2 Differences</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Excel is data presentation software even more than it is data
	storage software. The flexibility it offers reflects that. An Excel
	spreadsheet can store and display many differently structured chunks of data
	combined on the same sheet. SQL Server’s tables are each a single grid of
	information with a single structure.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Excel offers visualization tools, like graphs and pivot
	tables. SQL Server is intended as a backend data source for other applications
	that would provide the visualization, including Excel.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Excel offers simplicity and user-friendliness that a
	database by itself can’t offer. Anyone can open a new Excel spreadsheet and
	start typing. Database tables take more time and training to set up and use.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">The simplicity that Excel offers reflects its place, as I
	see it. If you have simple data or need to present data to users, Excel is
	often an excellent solution. As your data needs grow, Excel often cannot
	fulfill them anymore, and it’s time to look at a database.</p>

	<div class="Heading1">
	<h1><a id="_Toc45717245"></a>3.Why is a database better?</h1>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">I’d like to talk about the advantages of MS SQL Server and
	give you some ideas on why you might prefer to use a database over something
	like Excel. There are many powerful features offered by a database that a
	spreadsheet simply can’t match. Most of these features form the "structure" we
	are imposing on the data we are storing in the database. You can think of the
	structure as a set of laws intended to impose order on an otherwise "wild west"
	town made of data.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717246"></a>3.1 Unique ID</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">One thing seldom found in software outside a database is a
	primary key. A primary key is a unique code that enforces that uniqueness onto
	the data. No duplicates are allowed.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Social Security numbers, a UPC code on a product, or bank
	account numbers are all examples of primary keys. For example, there should
	never be two people with the same Social Security number. You can easily see
	the problems that would be caused if two people were trying to collect Social
	Security income utilizing the same number. They need to be unique or the
	process can’t work.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Creating and enforcing something like a primary key is very
	hard to do in Excel. In SQL Server, it is a short <a href="#_Toc45717261">SQL statement</a>
	that developers include in nearly every table.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717247"></a>3.2 Relational data</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">One of the most important features of database software is
	that it will allow you to interrelate your data. In this section, we will use
	an example of a list of customers, a list of products, and a table that relates
	those two, showing which customers bought which products, called "sales".</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2"><img id="RelationalData" src="https://gdurl.com/4OX0h" width="468" height="337" ></p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">You can set up connections between tables that enforce rules
	between them. These are referred to as foreign keys. &nbsp;A foreign key is a data
	integrity rule that effectively makes that connection between two tables. &nbsp;These
	tell the database, and a developer, how the data relates between the tables.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">In the sales table, only the ID of the customer and the ID
	of the product will be stored, not their names. This comes in very handy when
	a product name changes. You just update one record in the products table, and
	any applications or reports that use SQL based on these tables will
	automatically pick up the change.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">In addition, the connection between the tables prevents you
	from recording a sale for a customer who doesn’t exist in the "customers"
	table, or a product that isn’t in the products table. In other words, it
	prevents clearly incorrect data from being recorded.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">If you were storing data like this in Excel, automatic
	updates and this type of rule enforcement are unavailable. You would likely
	need to update multiple records, increasing work and the likelihood of error.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717248"></a>3.3 Transactions</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Transactions are the basis for trustworthy data.&nbsp;
	Transactions are a validation that any update to database data was completed
	successfully.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">When a change is submitted to a database the application
	submitting the change isn’t just throwing out an update and trusting that the
	data has been changed. The application gets back either a completion message
	or an error, so it can move on to the next line of code (if any) or handle any
	error generated by the attempted database update.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Multiple updates to a database can be linked together with
	code into a single transaction. This means that if any one of the updates
	fails the whole transaction fails, and no changes are committed to the database
	data.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">The classic database transaction example is a bank transfer
	of funds between two accounts. Money is deducted from one account and added to
	another. Both updates must be completed successfully or neither update is
	kept.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">What if an application deducted money from one account but
	the computer running the code was turned off before the application could add
	it to the other account? &nbsp;If the application is not properly coded, the money
	just disappears.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">With a database transaction linking both updates, it
	guarantees the money cannot be lost. The transaction says that the withdrawal
	cannot happen if the deposit doesn’t happen too, and the application attempting
	the update will have an error.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717249"></a>3.4 Data Rule Enforcement</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">There is an old saying in computer programming: "garbage in,
	garbage out". This saying implies that no matter how good your program is, if
	your users give it bad input, you will get bad results. This applies very much
	with unstructured data. Unstructured data is likely to have "garbage" entered
	in, which can cause many issues when it comes time to consume that data.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Millions of people around the world store important data in
	Excel. While it is possible to automatically enforce rules in Excel, very few
	users do so, and even fewer do it properly.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">The first level of data rule enforcement is data type (e.g.
	integer, decimal, text, date, binary). You assign a data type to every column
	in a table, and if the wrong type of data is attempted to be inserted into even
	one of the columns, then the whole insert attempt is rejected.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">As discussed under <a href="#_Toc45717247">Relational data</a>
	, foreign keys are another type of data rule enforcement.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Data rule enforcement is built into good database software.&nbsp;
	Beyond the fundamental types of rule enforcement I just mentioned, SQL Server
	gives you the ability to apply incredibly sophisticated rules, should you
	desire it.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717250"></a>3.5 Backups</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Database backups are more robust than the sorts of backup solutions
	with which most people are familiar. In addition to file backups done to your
	database, every single transaction hitting a database is logged as it completes
	successfully. This allows not only reliable data but also means you can
	restore a database to a specific point in time.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">You can think of the transaction log as a list of every
	single INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE command issued to the database in the order
	in which they happened.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2" style="page-break-after:avoid;">Conceptual example of a
	transaction log</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2"><img id="TransactionLog" src="https://gdurl.com/sFcR" width="577" height="94" ></p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Imagine a scenario where a developer updates an application
	with buggy code that inadvertently deletes thousands of rows of vital data.&nbsp;
	After the developer halts the bad updates, they can combine the latest database
	file backup with the database transaction logs up to the point in time when
	things started to go wrong. This will effectively take the database back in
	time to the point they indicate.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717251"></a>3.6 Data centralization</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Data centralization is not the physical centralization of
	data, but rather the process of setting up your different datasets so that they
	can be accessed together. This usually means loading many datasets onto a
	single database server (or linked servers) so the data can be combined,
	correlated, or compared.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Bringing your data together in one location solves crucial
	problems, saves works, and creates new opportunities. Data centralization is a
	task that gets more and more important when the number of different datasets,
	and their size, grow larger.</p>

	<h3>3.6.1 Solving problems</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Imagine a company that has grown rapidly recently. A single
	group of employees used to maintain the sales records in Excel, but that had to
	be split into regional groups to accommodate the number of sales, as the
	company grew. Each region was given a copy of the employee spreadsheet, the
	customer spreadsheet, and must track their own sales spreadsheet.</p>

	<ul class="ul-02">
	<li>Overhead: Having multiple people updating lists of employees and
	customers is time wasted that could be spent doing other things.</li>

	<li>Consistency: Multiple different people in the company trying to maintain
	lists of employees, customers, and sales is going to create a lot of errors.&nbsp;
	Lost time to correct errors, mishandled sales, and lost customers all add up to
	money wasted.</li>

	<li>Reporting: Every time the CEO wants a report on sales, they must
	wait for each region to report their sales and then have all the data combined.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">The decision is made to move to a database, and I.T. has
	been tasked to keep centralized tables updated with all employee and customer
	information. The regional sales groups are now only responsible for recording
	their sales in the database.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Manhours are saved so the sales groups can focus on sales.
	The data will be consistent across groups and more accurate. Reporting will be quick
	and easy, allowing management to make decisions faster and with greater
	confidence.</p>

	<h3>3.6.2 Interconnection</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">In that same company, I.T. is tasked with keeping phone
	records for the sales group. They will see how much total time the sales
	employees spend on the phone and how long they spend on each call. I.T. links
	up both sets of data by employee, so they can now relate sales to phone
	statistics in reports. Now that I.T. can tie company sales records to phone
	records, employees can see information like who is closing sales in the least
	amount of time, or the most. This reporting allows management to provide
	rewards or additional training where it might be needed.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">This sort of data interconnection is getting more advance
	and complex all the time. Interconnecting information on potential customers is
	one of the fastest areas of growth in the tech world.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717252"></a>3.7 Size</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">The sheer size of data a database can handle can’t be
	matched by spreadsheet software. The number of rows available in Excel is
	limited to just over 1,000,000. SQL Server tables can and do hold billions of
	rows. Its real limit is how much storage space is available.</p>

	<h1><a id="_Toc45717254"></a>4.When should you use a database?</h1>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">Choosing when to make the move to a database is difficult.&nbsp;
	If you’ve been dependent on spreadsheets, it’s going to be a big change to the
	way you and your employees have been doing things. As a database developer, I
	am biased, but I would say that the sooner you make the move the better. The
	longer you and your employees continue with your old methods, the harder they
	are to change. Consider a few of the key elements in this section to help you
	make the call.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717255"></a>4.1 Size</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Microsoft Excel can hold just over 1,000,000 rows of data,
	but you should move to a database long before coming close to that limit.&nbsp;
	Stability and speed alone will represent issues in a spreadsheet containing
	hundreds of thousands of rows.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Despite that 1,000,000-row limit seeming a long way off,
	Excel is not really intended to be used for data that large. If you have a
	spreadsheet coming up on 100,000 rows, it’s time to think about using a
	database. Who is going to consume 100,000 rows of data in Excel, except to
	summarize it? If you are summarizing all that data, you are already better off
	in a database and just outputting to Excel for your users. A database is going
	to do it better and faster.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717256"></a>4.2 Complexity</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">My professional experience has been that as soon as you try
	to interconnect Excel spreadsheets, you are in trouble. Before I was trained
	to become a database developer, I worked in a department that was trying to
	consolidate data for management from a variety of sources. I shudder now to
	think about the number of links present on the main dashboard of that
	spreadsheet.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2" style="page-break-after:avoid;">Over-complicated Excel
	spreadsheet example</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2"><img id="ComplexExcel" src="https://gdurl.com/3LrG" width="623" height="274" ></p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Our department owned some of the spreadsheets linked from
	that dashboard, but some were owned by other departments or were autogenerated
	from applications. Every morning was spent collecting data from different
	sources and tracking down issues. Sometimes an application failed to produce
	the spreadsheet on time, or a spreadsheet had been changed so the cell we were
	aiming for wasn’t there, or the whole file was missing.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Everything we had should have been moved over to a database
	a long time prior to it getting to that point. That’s my lived worst-case
	scenario, but where is the threshold? When is it time to move to a database?</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">I can’t recommend it highly enough to move sooner rather
	than later. The benefits gained are huge, and the learning curve for basic
	database functionality isn’t as high as you think. As soon as you have
	multiple people updating similar data, or you are trying to link spreadsheets
	together, you need to seriously consider moving to a database.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717257"></a>4.3 Cost</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Cost is usually the biggest factor holding people back from
	making the switch. You have three basic factors to consider: hardware, software,
	and salaries. The costs of SQL Server are very low for a small user base but
	escalate quickly when you scale up. For specific cost information, see the
	link under <a href="#_License_costs">License costs</a>.</p>

	<h3>4.3.1 Scenarios</h3>

	<ol class="ol-01">
	<li>You are a business owner with 15 employees, and you have the time and
	inclination to learn how to use SQL Server yourself. You have a large amount
	of data to deal with but have no plans to serve customers data directly. From
	a cost perspective, this is an almost ideal situation to migrate to SQL
	Server. You can use SQL Server Express, which is free. This will leave you
	with the cost of a server, but for 15 employees, almost any PC will work fine
	as a server.</li>
	<li>You are the CEO of a small company of 75 employees. You do not have time
	to work with SQL Server yourself, and you want to offer a website directly to
	your customers where they can read about your large selection of products. You
	can get SQL Server Standard Edition. It’s going to cost you at least $8,000
	for a license that will last for years and $3,000 for a good server.</li>
	<li>You are the CTO of a company of 350 employees
	spread out all over the country, your employees need all kinds of data handled,
	and need to be processing sales directly with customers. It’s time to go to the
	cloud. You’ll be looking at a data warehouse and web serving configuration.&nbsp;
	You won’t have to pay for servers yourself, or the staff to maintain them, but
	the cloud services are going to be $5,000/month and are going to increase as
	your user base increases in size.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1><a id="_Toc45717258"></a>5. How a database works</h1>
	</div>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717259"></a>5.1 Under the hood</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">I have put a link in the <a href="#_Materials">Materials
	section</a> of this document where you can download SQL Server’s free Express
	Edition. If you chose to do so, also download and install SQL Server
	Management Studio to provide you with a graphical user interface.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">In the sections below, we are going to talk about some of
	the underlying pieces of SQL Server, and being able to view them may help your
	understanding. I would encourage you to try it out.</p>

	<h3>5.1.1 Master Database</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">As the name implies, the master database is the database
	over all the other databases. It’s essentially a database of databases. All
	the components of databases you create are listed there, though not the data.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">You will find information about:</p>

	<ul class="ul-02">
	<li>Security (e.g. - users, logins)</li>
	<li>Database Objects (e.g. - databases, tables, columns)</li>
	<li>Server Objects (e.g. - database instances, links to other servers)</li>
	<li>Server Settings (e.g. - database replication)</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">While I encourage you to look around in your own instance of
	this database, use extreme caution in a professional situation; the risk to
	cause major problems is high.</p>

	<h3>5.1.2 MSDB Database</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">The MSDB database stores information about major services
	provided in SQL Server. &nbsp;If you are wondering what "MSDB" stands for, I cannot
	enlighten you, because Microsoft has failed to make it clear. I think of it as
	"Microsoft Database," but that is not official.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Main services controlled from MSDB are:</p>

	<ul class="ul-02">
	<li>SQL Server Agent – Server "jobs" are controlled by this service.&nbsp;
	Jobs are how we automate processes directly on SQL Server without the need for
	an external application. For example, you could schedule a nightly data delete
	from a database or a weekly transfer of data between databases.</li>
	<li>Database Mail – Emails can be generated directly from the server
	by this service, usually instigated by a job process.</li>
	<li>Service Broker – Advanced functions of built-in workload
	distribution are handled here.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">MSDB also stores logs of backups and restores of databases
	and supports features of SSMS.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717260"></a>5.2 Data flow</h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Below is a conceptual diagram
	of how an application interacts with a database. As you can see, there are
	multiple layers that information must traverse before an application will know
	that a submitted database request has been completed, and data (if any) is
	returned.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2"><img src="https://gdurl.com/Vu0b"></p>

	<div class="Heading1">
	<h1><a id="_Toc45717261"></a>6. Introduction to SQL</h1>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">The <a href="https://www.ansi.org/">American National Standards Institute (ANSI)</a>
	has set standards for the language the databases use: SQL (Structured Query
	Language). Nearly all major database platforms conform to ANSI standards.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">On top of that, different database technologies provide
	custom functions and capabilities of their own, but the basic underlying syntax
	for SQL statements should be consistent if a database claims to be
	ANSI-compliant.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">Common code formatting practices have keywords in all caps,
	to visually differentiate them from objects like tables and columns. That is
	why the following sections will have capital letters used for SQL keywords.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat1">These are going to be simple examples, intended to
	demonstrate the basics. Those basics are going to come up often when working
	on databases.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717262">6.1 DDL (Data Definition Language)</a></h2>
	</div>

	<h3>6.1.1 CREATE TABLE</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">This is the basic building block of your database, and it is
	where most of the database-side data validation will be set. The name of our
	example table is "HumanResources.Department". "HumanResources" is the schema
	name and "Department" is the table name.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">A schema is often used as a way of categorizing your tables
	but has additional functionality too. They are most often used for security
	and organization.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Below the "schema.table" name is the column names section. Each
	of the columns in your table receives the data type that is defined here. Data
	types set the size of memory available for the data stored there and are
	strictly enforced. If you try to insert or update data to an invalid type, the
	SQL statement will fail.</p>

	<h2><a id="_Toc45717263">6.2 DML (Data Definition Language)</a></h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">There are four basic concepts in databases: Create, Read,
	Update, and Delete. "CRUD" is the common mnemonic to remember them.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">The SQL keywords map neatly over to:</p>

	<ul class="ul-01">
	<li>Create = INSERT</li>
	<li>Read = SELECT</li>
	<li>Update = UPDATE</li>
	<li>Delete = DELETE</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>6.2.1 INSERT</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">INSERT is how you add new rows of data to the database. You
	need to strictly conform to all the data types for every column, but you can
	exclude columns from the insert statement if the column allows NULL values to
	be inserted. "NULL" means "no data" and doesn’t have a value.</p>

	<h3>6.2.2 UPDATE</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">UPDATE statements are used to change existing data in your
	database. You can update any number of columns in a single statement, but only
	one table at a time. They will succeed or fail together.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">The WHERE clause is a part of a query that allows you to restrict
	the rows impacted or returned. It is not changing any values like the code in
	the SET clause of the UPDATE statement. You don’t usually need to address
	every row in a table, so WHERE clauses are very common.</p>

	<h3>6.2.4 SELECT</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">SELECT is how you read data from the database. Simple

	validation.</p>

	<span class="SQLFieldNames">HumanResources.Department</span>
	</p>

	</div>

	<h3>6.2.5 JOIN</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">More complex SELECT statements usually involve interrelating
	the data in multiple tables. You do this by adding JOIN statements to the
	SELECT. You join tables using a common data element.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">In the below example, we are reading a table that contains
	information about what department employees served in over a period (HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory).&nbsp;
	It stores the employee’s ID for a date range to show which department ID and
	shift ID applied at the time.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Since that table is mostly just ID codes, we need to join it
	up to other tables to get a human-readable set of data. We join this history
	table to the person table, department table, and the shift table using the
	unique IDs found there.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Once those tables are joined, we can assemble a report that
	anyone can read. I added in the criteria that the "EndDate IS NULL" because an
	EndDate being present implies that the employee no longer works in that
	department, and I want current data.</p>

	<h2><a id="_Toc45717265">7.1 Indexes</a></h2>

	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Indexes are how a database finds data quickly. Imagine a
	reference book in a 3-ring binder with hundreds of pages of information. An
	index is like adding tabs to sections of the book. The tabs let you flip
	quickly to the section you need.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">You can add multiple indexes to a table; however, you must
	be careful how many you add. If you index every column in the table, it’s like
	putting a tab on every page of that book. It adds a lot of extra weight to the
	book while being nearly useless.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">With one exception (clustered index described below) every
	index takes up hard drive space. Unused indexes will slow down queries on the
	table, so be prudent in your index choices.</p>

	<h3>7.1.1 Clustered Index</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">A clustered index is the physical order in which the data is
	stored on the hard drive. You might put the clustered index on the "LastName"
	column of a table of employees. Each row would be stored alphabetically by
	last name on the hard drive. This makes accessing data by last name very fast.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Often it is best to put the clustered index on the unique
	identifier column of each table. Data stored in order by a known unique value
	helps the database engine with optimizing query efficiency.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">A table with no clustered index is known as a "heap". There
	are virtually no situations where a heap is better than an ordered table.</p>

	<h3>7.1.2 Primary Keys</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">The primary key is a column or combination of columns that
	uniquely identifies a row of data in a table. A table can only have one
	primary key. It cannot be set to a null value. It is often used as the
	clustered index on the table.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Usually, a value is created for a primary key if the data in
	the table doesn’t already have one. For example, if you were creating an
	"employees" table, you might set their social security number as the table’s
	primary key. However, this is often not permitted, as this might expose
	employees’ Social Security numbers. So, a new column with a new value would be
	added to the table to stand as the primary key.</p>

	<h3>7.1.3 Other Indexes</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">You can add more indexes to your tables as your applications
	and reporting require them. Additional indexes can be flagged as unique or not
	depending on the data in the column. Flagging an index as unique will force
	data integrity checks, and non-unique values will not be allowed in that column.</p>

	<div class="Heading2">
	<h2><a id="_Toc45717266">7.2 Execution plans</a></h2>
	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">Demand for tuning your database will grow as its size and
	user-demand both increase. Performance tuning is crucial to keeping your costs
	under control and your users happy. There are books and numerous tools that
	can be utilized to help you tune your database.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat2">The bread-and-butter of tuning is reviewing the execution
	plan for your SQL. An execution plan shows you how SQL Server is breaking down
	your SQL into logical chunks and organizes them to give you your results.</p>

	<h3>7.2.1 Example Execution Plan 1</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">This query returns a list of first names from the "Person.Person"
	table and sorts them in alphabetical order.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3"><img id="ExecutionPlan1" src="https://gdurl.com/WeEa"></p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">This is a very simple execution plan generated by SQL Server
	Management Studio (SSMS). The results are read from right to left, as the
	arrows point. It is showing you that it is retrieving the list of FirstName
	values from "Person.Person", then sorting them, and returning them to the
	screen.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">To tune a query, you look at the "Cost" values, and target
	steps with high costs. In this case, it’s the sort step, but this SQL doesn’t
	need tuning. Even though the relative cost is high, that is normal and
	appropriate for a sort in a query this size.</p>

	<h3>7.2.2 Example Execution Plan 2</h3>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Let’s look at one with a problem. The below query is very
	similar to the last, but now we are restricting the results to just employees
	whose first names begin with the letter "s".</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3"><img id="ExecutionPlan2" src="https://gdurl.com/Chaw"></p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">The higher cost has shifted over to the data retrieval,
	where we would prefer it not to be. Beyond that, SQL Server has even suggested
	a fix to our issue. The green text there is a SQL statement that it recommends
	we use to resolve the issue.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">Below the SQL statement is easier to read. It just adds an
	index to the FirstName column.</p>

	<div class="CodeBlock">

	<p class="CodeFormat2">
	<span class="SQLKeywords">CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX </span>
	<span class="SQLFieldNames">IX_FirstName</span>
	</p>

	<p class="CodeFormat2">
	<span class="SQLKeywords">ON </span>
	<span class="SQLFieldNames">Person.Person</span>
	<span class="SQLPunctuation">(</span>
	<span class="SQLFieldNames">FirstName</span>
	<span class="SQLPunctuation">)</span>
	</p>

	</div>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">After the index is added, we see a much better execution
	plan. The index has not only resolved the performance problem caused by
	filtering the FirstName column but has resolved the speed issue with the sort.&nbsp;
	SQL Server goes straight to the new index and does all its work very quickly.</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3"><img id="ExecutionPlan3" src="https://gdurl.com/vp1G"></p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">&nbsp;</p>

	<p class="NormalFormat3">The execution plans offered in SSMS are vital but will not
	resolve all your problems. As I said before, there are books written on this
	topic, but even more frequently, just knowing your database well is going to be
	the key to resolving performance issues.</p>
